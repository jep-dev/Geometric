# Geometric
A combination of the RAII approaches from Glaii and new abstract/geometric algebra constructs.

## Setup
On Linux, you will need the following libraries:
* glbinding: `sudo apt-get install libglbinding-dev`
* SOIL: `sudo apt-get install libsoil-dev`
* DevIL: `sudo apt-get install libdevil-dev`
* SDL2: `sudo apt-get install libsdl2{,-gfx,-image,-mixer,-net,-ttf}-dev`

Altogether, you can install the requirements using the following:
`sudo apt-get install libglbinding-dev libsoil-dev libdevil-dev libsdl2{,-gfx,-image,-mixer,-net,-ttf}-dev`

You will also probably need to install drivers for your CPU/GPU; check for available drivers in the "Additional Drivers" section of your settings.
